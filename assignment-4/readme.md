[Assigment statement](https://sites.google.com/a/umbc.edu/datavisualization/assignments/assignment-4-temporal-data-visualization)  
[Group proposal](https://github.com/esturcke/cmsc-636-data-vis/tree/master/assignment-4/BoyerJusticeStoreySturckeProposal.pdf)  

## Part 1: Design & Discussion

### Change Tasks

#### Task 1

> It is possible to group these patients into cohort where each cohort shares
> similar encounters. A cohort is a group of patient with similar attributes
> (e.g., age, gender, encounters, temporal progress). What are those encounters
> that are co-occurring?

  - **Change Task 1:** Forming cohorts of patients with a certain symptom....

#### Task 2

> What are the new encounters patients are likely to experience? What are the
> rare encounters?

#### Task 3

> What are the encounters repeating themselves? 

  * tasks and dataset attributes description (R0, 20 points)
  * mapping tasks and data needs in encoding process (15 points)
  * encoding choices comparisons (4(b) above, 20 points)

## Part 2: Implementation

  * program runs (10 points)
  * implement the matrix view (40 points)
    - basic matrix (10)
    - coloring hue (10)
    - coloring luminance (10)
    - cell splitting (10 points)
  * critical evaluation (5)
