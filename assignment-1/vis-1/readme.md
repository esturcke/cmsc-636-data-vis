This started as a check to see where there were inconsistencies in age at
encounter and encounter dates. It tuned out that there were no inconsistencies.
This graph is a work in progress but shows an interesting characteristic that
would allow for birth dates to be reconstructed more accurately than intended
from the data.

The vis is a bit difficult to explain, but each encounter has a date as well
as the age of the patient. That gives a 1 year birth date window. Moving across
each encounter we can calculate these windows and close in on a range of possible
birth dates. Plotting these values relative to an average estimated birth date
show both that there is a range that is always in the window (i.e. no inconsistencies)
but also a step periodic to 1 year. Although I have not had time to pursue this
further, this would allow even closer reconstruction of the birth date.
